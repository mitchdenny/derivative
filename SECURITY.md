## Security

The security of this project is taken seriously. While this is a personal project, I appreciate the responsible disclosure of any security vulnerabilities you may find.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use GitHub's private security vulnerability reporting feature:

**[Report a security vulnerability](https://github.com/mitchdenny/derivative/security/advisories/new)**

This allows for private discussion and coordination before public disclosure.

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include as much of the following information as possible to help understand and address the issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. code injection, authentication bypass, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Time

I will do my best to respond to security reports in a timely manner. Please understand that as a personal project, response times may vary.

## Preferred Languages

All communications should be in English.

## Disclosure Policy

I follow the principle of responsible disclosure. Once a security issue is reported and fixed, I will work with the reporter to coordinate public disclosure of the vulnerability.
